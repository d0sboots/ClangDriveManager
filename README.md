# ClangDriveManager

This script is used to manage clang drives in the game Space Engineers.

__Important__: I didn't create this. This was originally a clone from Major Jon's Steam Workshop project at https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1958861776. It works with the following clang drives (also created by them):

* [MPD-1 Merge Pulse Drive](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1958911211)
* [MSD-2-21 Mass Shifting Drive (old)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1921175914)
* [MSD-35 Mass Shift Drive (new)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007481346)
* [MSD-2-S Mass Shift Drive](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2007471064)
* [PDD-3 Piston Door Drive](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1930234081)
* [PDD-1 Piston Door Drive](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2005989020)
* [MID-6-3 Merge Inertial Dampener](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2102080820)

I've uploaded it GitHub because version control, since I have made my own modifications and improvements to the original script.
